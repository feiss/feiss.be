    Surprisingly, <a href=" http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=top&cat=Graphics" target="_blank">I
        came
        #1 in Graphics category!!</a>, tied with <a
        href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=31095" target="_blank">conormn"s
        wonderful entry</a>.
</p>
<p>Also, I came #23 in Mood category, which is preety cool too when you think there were 1493 participants! :)</p>
<p>It"s very rewarding giving that I did <a href="http://feiss.be/ld29/">Beneath the Cave</a> in just 6 hours. I wonder
    how it would end if I had spend two full days.. It would have some gameplay, at least :)</p>
<p>Waiting for the next Ludum Dare!</p>
