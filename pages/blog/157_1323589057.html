I had seen bits and pieces, but the video is quite cool. I like it indeed, the whole thing seems very slick and neat,
with some nice ideas (the clock/calendar is quite similar to what I was thinking!<br> Impressed too of how much they got
"inspired" by the macosx! but well, that"s for good :<br> Thanks for sharing! But I"m afraid Linux still has the same
problem as when I left it. Too much fragmentation and lacking a bit of cohesion, and underlying overcomplexity. Well,
the fragmentation is not a real problem, but the core of all Linux philosophy.. It"s difficult, but it"s improving the
user experience *a lot*, that"s for sure<br> Thanks!!
