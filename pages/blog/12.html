<div>I"ve updated <a href="http://www.feiss.be/hello/?func=prof" target="_blank">my web</a> with last shot I"ve done for
    <a href="http://malditobastardo.net" target="_blank">Maldito Bastardo!</a> (Damn Bastard!). <br>
    <br>
    This involved a landscape replacement and turning the footage into night. The latter was preety easy with color
    corrections, but the former was a bit tricky because in the original footage the character is in front of large
    bushes and trees, and his silouette is not clear <strong>at all</strong>. <br>

    I started with traditional After Effects masking, but after 4 frames it became a vertex nightmare (the silouette
    changes a lot) and the feathering didn"t worked at all (one arm is motion blurred, the other one is not.. same with
    legs... and above all, the guy has got long hair.. ), so the faster (?) and best way to do it was painting a mask
    frame by frame in Photoshop.<br>
    <br>
    Was a hard work, indeed. To paint the motion blur, preserve the same silouette along adjacent frames without much
    flickering.. Photoshop CS3"s animation/video features and timeline turned out to be really really handy!!<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, The result it"s not perfect at all, it still flickers a bit, but it"s a very short shot, doesn"t deserve
    more time.. :P<br>

    I"ve published in my web a sort of "making of", showing the layers and composition. Look it <a
