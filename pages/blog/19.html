<h2>Save Recipients to Address Book</h2>
<div class="postdate" time="1198729898"></div>
<div>I"ve recently installed wonderful <strong>Leopard</strong>, and realized that all my Address Book contacts were
    lost :( <br>
    <br>
    So, I"ve just write an Applescript to save in <strong>Address Book</strong> all contacts from <strong>"Sent
        Messages"</strong> mailboxes of <b>Mail</b>. I don"t know if there is an easier way to do it, but well, it was
    an excuse to learn (and have fun with) <strong>Applescript</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    It creates a new group <strong>"From Script"</strong> in Address Book with the added contacts. If you want to delete
    them, select all and click on <strong>Edit/Remove Cards</strong> (if you just press delete key it will be removed
    from the group).<br>

    Here you have it: <a href="http://www.feiss.be/blog//data/-1/SaveRecipients2AddressBook.app"
        target="_blank">SaveRecipients2AddressBook.app</a>. Just double click it to run.<br>
