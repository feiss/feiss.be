    Last month I worked on a game with <a href=" http://jorgefuentes.net" target="_blank">Jorge Fuentes</a>, which we
    called <strong>Zoi</strong>. Starting from his idea about a triangle jumping on blocks coming towards it, we
    finished the HTML5 game in a week, using the <a href="http://phaser.io" target="_blank">Phaser</a> library.
</p>
<p>In the first weeks we had quite a lot of visits and feedback (specially from the north of Africa and Middle East,
    thanks to being featured in <a href="http://www.th3professional.com/" target="_blank">this</a> website) and even ran
    a contest, daring players to get the furthest they could, recording the playthrough with a camera and uploading it
    to youtube. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzMbGoTiDxA" target="_blank">The winner</a> won 30â‚¬ worth of
    GOG.com games. Was really fun :D
</p>
<p>The fact is that the game was really addictive to many people and we thought it had a lot of potential, so I started
    to port it to iOS, which I did in another week"s time, using Apple"s <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html"
        target="_blank">SpriteKit</a>. The game was published for free in the App Store some days later, featuring Game
    Center scoreboards, achievements and an in-app purchase to remove the ads.</p>
<p>But that is not the end of the story. A couple of weeks later, <a href="http://www.gamesysmedia.com/"
        target="_blank">GameSys</a> contacted us, and after some emails and talks, <strong>they bought Zoi</strong>,
    both the actual game and the intellectual property. So that is why you will not find Zoi online or in the App Store
    now :)</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://feiss.be/games">games section</a> for some Zoi screenshots (game design and art by
    Jorge, programming by me), and if you search on youtube you can see <a
