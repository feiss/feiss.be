<h2>Old showreel video</h2>
<div class="postdate" time="1357906501"></div>
<p>
    Messing around a hard drive with backups I stumbled upon the showreel I did back in 2004, before my first "serious"
    job in a company. It is a bit chaotic, showing a bit of everything but nothing really interesting, without focus.
    This is a good example of how <strong>NOT</strong> to do a showreel.
</p>
<p>What -I think- still works quite well is the video itself, the rhythm and the feeling it has. I loved this song from
    <a href="http://penthagram.com" target="_blank">David García Díaz</a>, and made all the showreel synchronized with
    the beats of the music.</p>
