        que a algún guiri puede serle de ayuda.</i><br>
    <br>
    Hi!, Here are some tips for working with <b>large files</b> <i>(and I am talking of 10,000px, 20,000px.. but could
        be any that makes your computer scream)</i> in <b>Photoshop</b>. These are based on my own experience and may be
    not very technical, but for me it works :)<br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Memory</b><br>
            <br>
            This is an easy one: <u>The more memory you have, the better you will work</u>. However, do not hesitate to
            load your computer with 6 or 8 MB of RAM, because Photoshop only handles a maximum of <b>2GB</b> (<b>3GB</b>
            with XP64bits). With more memory the operative system and other programs will run better though.<br>
            <br>
            The memory reserved by PS at startup can be changed in <b>Edit/Preferences/Performance</b>, but the default
            setting is normally the best value. <b>Do not put it at 100%</b> with less than 4GB of RAM is a very bad
            idea, some memory has to be free for the Operative System.<br>
            <br>
            Look at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/kb401088" target="_blank">Adobe</a> for detailed information (Mac
            systems <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/kb401089" target="_blank">here</a>).
        </li><br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Settings in Edit/Preferences/Performance</b><br>
            <br>
            <img src="*ROOT*/data/-1/performance.gif" /><br>
            Here you can lower the <b>History States</b> (10, for example), and the <b>Cache Levels</b> (2, for
            example). Cache levels are mainly used for zooming out/in, so it will be slower when zooming, but it will
            consume less memory.<br>
            <br>
            Also, choose an <b>Scratch Disc</b> partition with lot of free space, with low desfragmentation and good
            speed. If you have it set to your 1GB-free <b>C:</b>, thats bad thing...
        </li><br>
        <br>
        <li><b>The Master Layer</b><br>
            <img src="*ROOT*/data/-1/layers.gif" align="right" /><br>
            Put <b>all</b> layers inside a master layer, and <b>HIDE it before saving</b> the file. This way Photoshop
            will not save a flattened version of the whole image inside the PSD, and you will reduce <b>A LOT</b> the
            saving time and the PSD size in disk.<br>
            <br>
            This is a very time-disk saver tip, but remember that when opening the file in any image viewer it will not
            show anything, because they use this inexistent flattened version.
        </li><br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Brush spacing</b><br>
            <br>
            <img src="*ROOT*/data/-1/spacing.jpg" /> <br>
            If you experience slow performance when painting, <b>increase</b> the Brush Spacing parameter. It will draw
            more separated strokes, but the performance will be very increased.
        </li><br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Crop it!</b><br>
            <br>
            This is a little odd but nice tip. When you are working in only a relative small area of your image,
            <b>hide</b> the other portion of it. This is done by cropping the image but using the parameter
            "<b>hide</b>" instead of the default one "<b>delete</b>":<br>
            <img src="*ROOT*/data/-1/crop.gif" /><br>
            This will result in an apparently cropped image, but do not panic, the rest of your image is still there
            (try to move a layer). <br>
            <br>
            The good news is that the performance of Photoshop will increase a lot, and you will work more confortable.
            The bad news is that you have to re-crop it to revert to the right sized version. This is done again by
            cropping it with <b>hide</b> option, but cropping to the right dimensions. Since you have lost them, a good
            way to do it is to save the document limits by setting 4 <b>guides</b>, before cropping it down:<br>
            <br>
            <img src="*ROOT*/data/-1/cropall.jpg" /><br>
            Now you can crop it back snapping the selection to those guides.

        <li><b>Other tips:</b><br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Deactivate thumbnails in layers window.</b> They are cute, but PS has to refresh everytime you
                    make a change</li><br>
                <li><b>Hide All Layer Effects</b>. This is a great performance penalti. If you can work with this layers
                    hidden or with its effect hidden, do it.</li><br>
                <li><b>Hide Color Correction Layers</b>. Another important performance penalti. Hide them if you can.
                </li><br>
            </ul>

    These are tips I can remember know. I hope all this can be useful for someone. Feel free to post more tips or
    questions. Enjoy! :)<br>
