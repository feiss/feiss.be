It"s funny because for a time I thought about programming mine too. Something without distractions-just like your idea!
Though it seemed like too much for one person only (with my knowledge at least)<br> Some feedback on this thought
experiment<br> - I like that windows that aren"t in the foreground get grayed out (fog style). Most managers tend to
apply 50% alpha to background windows and it ends up being a translucent mess :-<br>- I"m not so sure about having to
manage their z order manually, even with the mouse wheel it might get a bit cumbersom<br>- The IE icon .must.go.away.
It"s incredibly disturbing!<br>- Although I like the launcher windo<br>- Invisible scrollbars a la Lion are \"nice\"
until you get to use them. I got to use them recently and finally ended up enabling visible scrollbars instead. Most of
the time I didn"t quite click where the \"invisible area\" was and it was frustrating. Maybe this could be fixed with
some more allowance when invisible, not sure<br>- The clock on the center... nooo!! It"s like having someone reminding
you what time is it at all times. I"d rather have it hidden or visible only (fade in) when hovering near the top area.
Ideally it should be configurable. E.g. have it as an area for putting stuff that fades out when not active, so you can
put things like the clock and other notifications there<br>- Ideally I"d like to be able to put windows on top of the
\"clock\" area, not sure if you considered that<br> Did you think of the concept of workspaces? This is something you
either loathe or love. I"m curious about your opinion on this. It seems \"artists\" tend to avoid workspaces while
\"programmers\" abuse them.
