Hi Sole! :<br> It"s funny because for a time I thought about programming mine too. Something without distractions-just
like your idea! <br> haha cool :D I think the 90% of users don"t really use the 95% of the stuff what is visible on the
screen. That means something is wrong<br> Though it seemed like too much for one person only (with my knowledge at
least).<br> yes, for mine too.. I guess we could do something eventually, but we would need a lot of time to learn all
the stuff you have to put between the OS an the Applications.. buhf, too much stuff.<br> I like that windows that aren"t
in the foreground get grayed out (fog style). Most managers tend to apply 50% alpha to background windows and it ends up
being a translucent mess :-S <br> well, they get grayed out because the background is gray X) but yes, my intention is
to fade background windows as much as possible, with LOT of transparency (30% and more) and blurring.. In fact, maybe
the big background windows in the mockup are too visible yet.<br> I"m not so sure about having to manage their z order
manually, even with the mouse wheel it might get a bit cumbersome <br> I"m not sure too, I think that should be
something you have to test a lot with prototypes.<br> The IE icon .must.go.away. It"s incredibly disturbing!! <br> haha
XD it"s like saying \"look, you can EVEN use IE on it\". Yes, it"s a bit disgusting, sorry<br> Although I like the
launcher window <br> I think the launcher could work, definitively. Like a small swiss knife always ready and
convenient. And it"s something I/we could actually program! :<br><br> Invisible scrollbars a la Lion are \"nice\" until
you get to use them. I got to use them recently and finally ended up enabling visible scrollbars instead. Most of the
time I didn"t quite click where the \"invisible area\" was and it was frustrating. Maybe this could be fixed with some
more allowance when invisible, not sure.<br> Yup, you"re right. I guess something in between could be better.<br> The
clock on the center... nooo!! It"s like having someone reminding you what time is it at all times. I"d rather have it
hidden or visible only (fade in) when hovering near the top area. Ideally it should be configurable. E.g. have it as an
area for putting stuff that fades out when not active, so you can put things like the clock and other notifications
there.<br> That"s true, too.. I thought of it more as a simple decoration, as \"this is the only thing you"ll have, with
no windows open\". I like the hovering on top idea. And we should allow some space for notification stuff. I thought the
launcher could be a place, but near the clock -as the email icon- could work too<br> Ideally I"d like to be able to put
windows on top of the \"clock\" area, not sure if you considered that.<br> hmm.. maybe that could be configurable<br>
Did you think of the concept of workspaces? This is something you either loathe or love. I"m curious about your opinion
on this. It seems \"artists\" tend to avoid workspaces while \"programmers\" abuse them.<br> The idea of workspaces are
cool, but at the end of the day, you/I don"t use them. I used to have two workspaces 8 years ago, but not today. Maybe
is that I"m getting old and my attention span is much shorter, or maybe is that having workspaces you lose track of what
you have opened, or that is not really productive. If you don"t really see the window, why having it opened in another
workspace? don"t know.. it does not work for me anymore, at least<br> Thanks for your time! :D
