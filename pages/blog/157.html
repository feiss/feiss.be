<h2>One ideal (for me) Window Manager</h2>
<div class="postdate" time="1323505800"></div>
<div>
    <div>Today I was wondering how<b>&nbsp;my</b> ideal Window Manager would be. After some hours playing, I got this:
    </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div><a href="http://feiss.be/data/-1/osmockup_compositor.jpg"><img
                src="http://feiss.be/data/-1/osmockup_compositorlow.jpg" /></a></div>
    <div><a href="http://feiss.be/data/-1/osmockup_compositor.jpg"><br>
        </a></div>
    <div><a href="http://feiss.be/data/-1/osmockup_compositor.jpg">Click to maximize</a></div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>Before you say anything, I know I know, it needs to be polished lot more and it lacks TONS of things, but hey,
        it"s just a rough concept..&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>The main features are:</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>- With no windows opened, the only you see is the gray background and the clock, and optionally the mail icon
        informing of incoming messages/chats/twits/mails. If you click on the clock, the calendar (sort of fantastical)
        appears. Click on the mail icon to open chat/email/etc.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>- Windows have almost no chrome but a slight shadow. &nbsp;No title bars, no window buttons but just a simple
        <b>+</b> on the bottom right corner to maximize/restore the window. For moving/resizing, the
        <b>alt+click/drag</b> way of Linux is perfect (I miss that). No scrollbars too (or hidden, like macosx Lion"s)
        today all mice have scrollwheel.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>- When clicked Windows/Mac Cmd key a small centered window appears on top of everything. Is a <b>launcher</b>
        (kind of Quicksilver), which displays 4 things: An input box for searching for stuff (applications, folders,
        files, complex commands), a list of favorite folders, a list of favorite applications, and a list of icons for
        accessing administrative/system tasks. As soon as something is selected, the window disappear.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>- The workspace has a <b>third dimension</b> for sending windows backwards. I"m pretty sure somebody thought of
        this before (link?) I think it can work very well.. with some combination of key+mouse or scrollwheel, the
        windows can be send <b>back and forth</b>, so you can leave them in the background, so they don"t bother but you
        still can peek at their content (to know if some task finished, or to simply know which one to bring back).
        Depending of how far you send the window, it gets more/less blurred, transparent and small, so you can decide
        the level of "presence" of it. Moving windows in this dimension should feel confortable and intuitive, with some
        snap in the top level, etc.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>- It relies on <b>shortcuts</b>. They replace visual buttons/menus for common tasks, and specially the File
        Browser (copy/paste, new folder, information, &nbsp;preview, new browser...)</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>- The <b>File Browser</b> (bottom right window) shows files and folders (separately), no more. &nbsp;Right
        click should display a context menu with options for sorting, show/hide file size/date, and other tasks.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>This overall look should work with wallpapers and other theme colors (although the aim of it is the simplicity,
        clearness and readability, so it should be preferably designed with plain and simple color schemes in mind).
    </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>What do you think? do you see big mistakes? do you have any more ideas for it?</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>Cheers! :)</div>
