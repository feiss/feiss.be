    After long time admiring IQ"s work on raymarching (in <a
        href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/raymarchingdf/raymarchingdf.htm" target="_blank">his website</a> or
    in <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/user/iq" target="_blank">ShaderToy</a>), and specially on raymarching distance
    fields, I"ve always wanted to try to code one renderer of this kind on my own. I did a couple of basic raytracers in
    the past, and this technique seems even funnier, so I had to try it eventually.
</p>
<p>Thinking of doing something for the current <a href="http://js1k.com" target="_blank">js1k</a> javascript contest, I
    started a raymarcher in javascript. After some hours, this is what I got:</p>

<p>From top to bottom: basic "hit test" render, normals render, ray steps render, basic color with haze (fake lighting),
    and render with basic shading (diffuse+specular+shadows).</p>

<p><a href="http://feiss.be/exp/raymarching">Click here to try it</a>. Please give it some time to render (about 9 secs
    on this Macbook)</p>
<p>View source code for the guts of it, it"s fairly simple and short. Of course, the implementation is
    <strong>far</strong> of being optimal, good, or even decent. I even doubt it is useful for learning purposes, but
    maybe can help someone stuck in the first steps of the implementation of a raymarcher with distance fields. I just
    thought on being pragmatic and simple, didn"t give a damn about speed or beauty code.
</p>
<p>Very, very fun stuff! even funnier than raytracing, I"d say! :)</p>
