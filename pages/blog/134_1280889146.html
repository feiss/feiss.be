Hi :<br>The vars can be chained (and weren"t required for this compo, but good practice anyways).<br>The if"s can be
rewritten into ternary operators: `if(x)y;` to `x?y:0;` or `x&&y;`<br>Random could be cached
(M.random()M.random()M.random() vs R="random";m[R]()m[R]()m[R]()). Same for keyCode<br>I think the abs can be rewritten
but I don"t know that one by heart :<br> Just in case you"re looking to improve :)
