    <div>Yesterday watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOucwX7Z1HU">this BBC"s video</a> about how precise
        the average estimation made by a number of people can be. They call this "phenomenon" <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd">The wisdom of the crowd</a>. Is quite cool, isn"t
        it?</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>I"d love to make a fast and simple experiment, and you can help me.&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>Go to&nbsp;<a href=" http://feiss.be/exp/crowdwisdom/index.php">http://feiss.be/exp/crowdwisdom</a>&nbsp;and
        ask a simple question: How many sticks do you estimate there are in the image?</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>When I get some hundreds of answers I"ll post the result. Let"s see how wise is the crowd! :)&nbsp;</div>
