<h2>Ludum Dare #29 - Beneath the Cave</h2>

<p>
  This weekend another Ludum Dare took place. I was preety busy so I already had discarded to participate, but <strong>6
    hours</strong> before the deadline (Monday 3am) I had a chance and tried to make something.
  <br>
<p>
  This is what I managed to do: <a href="http://feiss.be/ld29">Beneath the Cave</a><br><br>

<p>Try to go to the end screen, there"s a little surprise. I"d love to add more gameplay, like talking with more animals
  (frog, rabbit, fox..), adding more obstacles, and more adventure game point-and-click type of elements. But well, I
  guess for 6 hours it was too ambitious, taking into account the time required for bug fixing and other technical
  stuff.
</p>
<p>The bird movements turned out surprisingly convincing, I think :)</p>
