    <p>A spanish cards game (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinch%C3%B3n_(card_game)"
        target="_blank">similar</a> to rummy) that offers a <strong>very polished</strong> and <strong>natural
        gameplay</strong> in multiple platforms.<br>
      I created all the graphics and the coding, and the cards were specifically designed for the game. </p>
