    <p>This was an image I did for <a href="http://www.strangebeast.tv/" target="_blank">Strange Beast</a> in a whole
      weekend. The deadline was in <strong>48 hours</strong>, so we had to stablish the composition and the elements
      very quick, after two conversations and two fast line sketches. Once the sketch on the right was approved, I did a
      rough color study based on the indications given by the director, who suggested a way pinker and brighter scheme,
      that gives the image a more appealing and technological feeling.</p>
    <p>In order to get a clean look and sharp finish in the towers and key paths, I decided to build them as 3d models
      (using <strong>Modo</strong>) and bring a basic render to Photoshop, were I tweaked everything and did the final
      composition.</p>
