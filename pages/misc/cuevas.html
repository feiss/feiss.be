      <p>This website was structured and programmed to be fully customizable by the user, who is able to edit sections
        and subsections, interactive backgrounds, news, contact data, links, downloadable files, multiple languages...
        Because of all this dynamic content and the transitions between sections (that produce an horizontal slide
        transition that changes <strong>everything</strong>), a new whole page is fully created from code each time the
        user changes to a new section.</p>
      <p>The main challenges of this project were to maintain a good framerate in the transitions, to support the
        dynamic content, and to have a very responsive layout of the content on every window size.</p>
