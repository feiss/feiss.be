  <h3>Concept Art for commercial *share_icons*</h3>
  <div class="grid_6">
    <p>Once more, I helped <a href="http://www.thefrankbartoncompany.com/" target="_blank">The Frank Barton Company</a>
      with some concept art for ONCE"s lottery TV ad. In this one, a bunch of hats fly over the city and land on some
      selected ("lottery winners") people.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a lot of information and references from Frank Barton (they always know very well what they want, which is
      really great), I started pencilling different views of the city. Then I made a full color version of some views,
      which they used as both color and lighting studies.
    </p>
    <p>The full commercial was done in a rush -less than a month- so it is pretty neat what they achieved in such short
      time.</p>
